# WKP8

Hello team! Here's the weekend project 8.

We're going to build a hit parade.

![./assets/hit-parade.jpg](./assets/hit-parade.jpg)

-   That's a list of songs, sorted from the most popular to the least popular.
-   When we add a new song to the hit parade, the song score is set to zero.
-   The song list is always sorted from the highest score song to the lowest.
-   We can increment the score by clicking the +1 button.
-   We wan delete a song from the list by clicking the bin icon.
-   We can filter the list, by searching for a song title
-   We can filter the list, by selecting a song style in the select.
-   When we click the _reset filters_ button, the filter form is reset, and the list comes back to normal.
-   The data will be saved on the localstorage (except when you filter data)

### Tips :

-   Focus on the features first, and if you have some time left, try to replicate this design.
-   Start by choosing the song data structure, and create a few of them in the code.
-   Focus on your basic app functionality first, and then try to save the state of your app to _Local Storage_.

Also, please update this readme with the answer to those questions before submitting the project.

### Student report :

I will download everybody's fork on **_Sunday at 5pm_**.

Good luck everyone! ðŸ”¥  

### Structure
  - Firstly, I created variables for the list of songs and the form.  
  - Secondly, I created new function to show the list of songs and put them in the html.
  - Thirdly, I added a new function to show the value from the input.
  - Then, I added a function to handle the click in submit button.

### What I have learnt
  - Today, I learnt how to get the values from input because before I did not know how to access them. 

### Timing
  - If I had more time, I would continue to work in the increment button and so on. Also, clean the code very well, added more style for css.

### The most challenging part 
  -For me, it was hard to get the images. I do not really know if it is because the url I added there or not.
